# Playing-with-Python
As I decided to move form academics to data science, Python was the first lanague I learnt.
I already had learnt C and C++in college so the basic concept of coding was clear; however, my coding skills had rusted completely. Navigating through the course gave me the confidence that I can still work my way through langauges.
Python is easy to learn - the syntax is easy and once you get hold of the concept, coding becomes simpler.
For anyone looking to learn Python or any new language as a matter of fact, I would suggest, be patient - don't try to learn everything at the same time. 
Life is short, I know, but somethings are better done with patience for proper resulls
