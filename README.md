# Playing-with-Python
As I decided to move form academics to data science, Python was the first language I learnt.
I already knew C and C++ from school and college so the basic concept of coding was clear; however, my coding skills had rusted completely. Navigating through the course Python for everybody by Dr Chuck gave me the confidence that I can still work my way through langauges.
Python is easy to learn - the syntax is easy and once you get hold of the concept, coding becomes simpler.
For anyone looking to learn Python or any new language as a matter of fact, I would suggest, be patient - don't try to learn everything at the same time. 
Life is short, I know, but somethings are better done with patience for proper results.

I also enrolled in MITx 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python on edx to learn the language further. Some of the algorithms I learned in the course were simply amazing. The tools are powerful and clear the concept like nothing else
